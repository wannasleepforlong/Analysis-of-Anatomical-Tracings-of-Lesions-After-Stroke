# Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models for Post-Stroke Lesion Detection

Stroke, a leading cause of death and disability globally, disrupts blood flow to a portion of the brain. This project explores recent advancements in deep learning for automated stroke lesion segmentation, focusing on four novel architectures: X-Net, V-Net, SegNet, and U-Net. The effectiveness of these models is evaluated on the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) dataset.
